## About The Project

The Blanja website is an e-commerce platform developed by me and my team during a bootcamp at Pijar Camp. Blanja offers various products from different categories, providing an easy and secure online shopping experience. In this project, I was responsible for developing the Front-End and also part of the Back-End, particularly in creating API requests for the shopping cart feature. By utilizing modern technology and best practices in web development, we successfully created a responsive and user-friendly platform.
